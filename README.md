# Finite Element Method

This repository is dedicated to all the code and calculations done during the "Introduction to the Finite Element Method" lectures during the second half of 2024 at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

I must acknowledge that much of the inspiration and learning came from the repository [Elementos_Finitos](https://github.com/bacarmo/Elementos_Finitos), from [Bacarmo](https://github.com/bacarmo) which has been an invaluable resource throughout this process.

You can check my final project at [FiniteElements2dDirichlet.jl](https://github.com/joaovictorlopezpereira/FiniteElements2dDirichlet.jl).

Any additional bibliography used is cited in the pdf files.
